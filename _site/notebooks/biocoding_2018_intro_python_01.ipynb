    "As you may notice in the code block above a Python keyword 'print' is highlighted in a color (green). We call 'print' a key word because this word has special meaning to Python. Python is considered one of the best languages for new coders to learn because compared to other programming languages it is much more intuitive. In the [C language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29) for example, printing 'Hello World' would look something like this: \n",
